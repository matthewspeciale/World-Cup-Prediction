# World-Cup-Prediction

This notebook will use the history of World Cup matches since 1998 in combination with the FIFA 18 videogame overall values of all the players on each squad.

So far, Support Vector Machine was used to determine how likely a team is to win determined by their history in the World Cup since 1998. 

Next, I am working on combining this feature with the overall skill of each squad. The model will be trained on the group stages and tested on the knockout stages. 

I plan on explaining each step in the process using Markdown between code cells once the project is completed.
